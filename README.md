# Browser Homepage Website

Since Zen Browser (Firefox) wasnâ€™t letting me customize the homepage like I wanted, I had to take matters into my own hands and build something fresh, frfr.

Oh, and just so you know, **ChatGPT** wrote this README because, come on, who writes READMEs in 2025? ðŸ¤–

This is a simple static homepage built with **SvelteKit**, **TypeScript**, and **TailwindCSS**. The page is clean, minimal, and designed to give you the most important info at a glance. Nothing extra, just what you need.

## Features
- **Multi Engine Search Bar**: Search across multiple engines at once.
- **Vim Motions**: Use Vim motions to navigate the page.
- **Url search**: The search bar recognizes URLs and opens them directly.
- **Current Time Display**: Always up-to-date, no cap. With some slick animations.
- **Dark mode Deep Black Background**: Sleek, modern, and a whole vibe. Oled-friendly.

## Framework and Tools
- **SvelteKit**: For building out the frontend with that fast, smooth flow.
- **TypeScript**: Keeps everything tight, no room for errors.
- **TailwindCSS**: Makes the page look clean and responsive without the fuss.

## How to Build
To build the project, hit these commands using **Bun** or **npm**:

### Using Bun
```bash
bun run build
```

### Using npm
```bash
npm run build
```

Once thatâ€™s done, youâ€™ll find the `build` folder with all the necessary files, including `index.html`, ready to deploy. No cap, itâ€™s that easy frfr. ðŸš€
